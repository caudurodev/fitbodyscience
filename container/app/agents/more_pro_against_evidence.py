        The task is to find evidence that is directly related to the assertion in the scientific literature.
        Search for scientific papers or widely accepted evidence that **directly and specifically** prove or disprove the assertion and provide a summary of their findings.
        Prefer primary research and highly ranked hierarchy of evidence over opinion, articles, and specialist opinions.
        Only return results which have a DOI number. 

        The studies should be for or against the assertion. The study should contribute to or disprove the 
        point/assertion being made.

        Do not include studies that only partially relate to the assertion or that address a broader or different topic.
        For example, if the assertion is about "eating high amounts of vegetables is not the best approach for longevity," focus on studies that specifically examine whether consuming high amounts of vegetables is or is not the best approach for longevity, possibly in comparison to other dietary strategies.

        Never return any results that match the already provided source_urls, studies, etc. 
        All papers must be new and not duplicates of what was already provided.
        Only return papers that are about the same subject matter. 
        Don't provide evidence that is from a different field of study that is unrelated.
        For example, don't provide a study about energy from electricity to support a claim about energy from food.
